Pantie

Pantie is somewhat complementar to sockets, and stands for Private Ajax Network Transmission Internal Executor.

The goal is to create a system for medium websites that would want HTTP push notifications from server to client,
but had some taste issues and decided to go with PHP for coding their application.

Of course, there is a lot of stuff, but it's too damn complex and full of bullshit for the small use I had initially,
that's why I created this in order to achieve somewhat some push, without any server setup or other hassle.

Come on, let me finish to code the lib first, you little impatient!
